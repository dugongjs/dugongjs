<p align="center">An event sourcing framework for Node.js.</p>

## Introduction

Many popular backend frameworks, such as Express and Nest.js, excel at handling networking, request life-cycle management, and other infrastructure concerns. However, these frameworks often do not address domain-driven design (DDD) concepts like aggregates, domain events, and the complexities of modeling business logic.

Dugong bridges this gap by offering a framework centered on event sourcing and domain-driven design principles. It empowers developers to model systems that are tightly aligned with the core business logic.

### Sample use case

This example demonstrates how a bank account can be modeled as an aggregate using Dugong. Weâ€™ll define commands and domain events representing actions such as opening an account, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and closing the account.

### Defining domain events

First, we define an abstract base class for events of the bank account aggregate.

```typescript
import { AbstractDomainEvent, type DomainEventPayload } from "@dugongjs/core";

export abstract class AbstractBankAccountDomainEvent<
    TPayload extends DomainEventPayload | null = null
> extends AbstractDomainEvent<TPayload> {
    public static readonly origin = "BankingService";
    public static readonly aggregateType = "BankAccount";
    public static readonly version = 1;
}
```

Next, we define a set of domain events for the aggregate, reflecting its business capabilities. Domain events may or may not carry payloads.

```typescript
@DomainEvent()
export class AccountOpenedEvent extends AbstractBankAccountDomainEvent<{ owner: string; initialBalance: number }> {
    public static readonly type = "AccountOpened";
}

@DomainEvent()
export class MoneyDepositedEvent extends AbstractBankAccountDomainEvent<{ amount: number }> {
    public static readonly type = "MoneyDeposited";
}

@DomainEvent()
export class MoneyWithdrawnEvent extends AbstractBankAccountDomainEvent<{ amount: number }> {
    public static readonly type = "MoneyWithdrawn";
}

@DomainEvent()
export class AccountClosedEvent extends AbstractBankAccountDomainEvent {
    public static readonly type = "AccountClosed";
}
```

### Defining commands

Next, we define a set of commands for the aggregate. These can be simple types or interfaces.

```typescript
export type OpenAccountCommand = {
    owner: string;
    initialBalance: number;
};

export type DepositMoneyCommand = {
    amount: number;
};

export type WithdrawMoneyCommand = {
    amount: number;
};
```

### Defining the aggregate

Finally, we define the bank account aggregate.

```typescript
import { AbstractAggregateRoot, Aggregate, Apply, CreationProcess, Process } from "@dugongjs/core";

@Aggregate("BankAccount")
export class BankAccount extends AbstractAggregateRoot {
    private owner: string;
    private balance: number;

    public getOwner(): string {
        return this.owner;
    }

    public getBalance(): number {
        return this.balance;
    }

    @CreationProcess()
    public openAccount(command: OpenAccountCommand): void {
        const event = this.createDomainEvent(AccountOpenedEvent, {
            owner: command.owner,
            initialBalance: command.initialBalance
        });

        this.stageDomainEvent(event);
    }

    @Process()
    public depositMoney(command: DepositMoneyCommand): void {
        if (command.amount <= 0) {
            throw new Error("Deposit amount must be greater than zero");
        }

        const event = this.createDomainEvent(MoneyDepositedEvent, {
            amount: command.amount
        });

        this.stageDomainEvent(event);
    }

    @Process()
    public withdrawMoney(command: WithdrawMoneyCommand): void {
        if (command.amount <= 0) {
            throw new Error("Withdraw amount must be greater than zero");
        }

        if (this.balance < command.amount) {
            throw new Error("Insufficient funds");
        }

        const event = this.createDomainEvent(MoneyWithdrawnEvent, {
            amount: command.amount
        });

        this.stageDomainEvent(event);
    }

    @Process()
    public closeAccount(): void {
        const event = this.createDomainEvent(AccountClosedEvent);

        this.stageDomainEvent(event);
    }

    @Apply(AccountOpenedEvent)
    public applyAccountOpened(event: AccountOpenedEvent): void {
        const payload = event.getPayload();

        this.owner = payload.owner;
        this.balance = payload.initialBalance;
    }

    @Apply(MoneyDepositedEvent)
    public applyMoneyDeposited(event: MoneyDepositedEvent): void {
        const payload = event.getPayload();

        this.balance += payload.amount;
    }

    @Apply(MoneyWithdrawnEvent)
    public applyMoneyWithdrawn(event: MoneyWithdrawnEvent): void {
        const payload = event.getPayload();

        this.balance -= payload.amount;
    }

    @Apply(AccountClosedEvent)
    public applyAccountClosed(): void {
        this.delete();
    }
}
```

The functions marked with the `@Process()` decorator generate events, and the functions marked with the `@Apply()` decorator apply those events to the aggregate, updating its state. By separating command handling and state mutation, the aggregate can be fully rehydrated from the event log.

### Interacting with the aggregate

In the application layer, we may reconstruct the aggregate from the event log and execute commands on it. Here is an example using a Nest service. The `createAggregateContext` method returns an `AggregateContext` with access to factory and management methods.

```typescript
import { EventSourcingService } from "@dugongjs/nestjs";
import { Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";

@Injectable()
export class BankAccountCommandService {
    constructor(private readonly eventSourcingService: EventSourcingService) {}

    public async openAccount(command: OpenAccountCommand): Promise<BankAccount> {
        return this.eventSourcingService.transaction(async (transaction) => {
            const bankAccountContext = this.eventSourcingService.createAggregateContext(transaction, BankAccount);

            const bankAccount = new BankAccount();

            bankAccount.openAccount(command);

            await bankAccountContext.applyAndCommitStagedDomainEvents(bankAccount);

            return bankAccount;
        });
    }

    public async depositMoney(bankAccountId: string, command: DepositMoneyCommand): Promise<BankAccount> {
        return this.eventSourcingService.transaction(async (transaction) => {
            const bankAccountContext = this.eventSourcingService.createAggregateContext(transaction, BankAccount);

            const bankAccount = await bankAccountContext.build(bankAccountId);

            bankAccount.depositMoney(command);

            await bankAccountContext.applyAndCommitStagedDomainEvents(bankAccount);

            return bankAccount;
        });
    }

    public async withdrawMoney(bankAccountId: string, command: WithdrawMoneyCommand): Promise<BankAccount> {
        return this.eventSourcingService.transaction(async (transaction) => {
            const bankAccountContext = this.eventSourcingService.createAggregateContext(transaction, BankAccount);

            const bankAccount = await bankAccountContext.build(bankAccountId);

            bankAccount.withdrawMoney(command);

            await bankAccountContext.applyAndCommitStagedDomainEvents(bankAccount);

            return bankAccount;
        });
    }

    public async closeAccount(bankAccountId: string): Promise<BankAccount> {
        return this.eventSourcingService.transaction(async (transaction) => {
            const bankAccountContext = this.eventSourcingService.createAggregateContext(transaction, BankAccount);

            const bankAccount = await bankAccountContext.build(bankAccountId);

            bankAccount.closeAccount();

            await bankAccountContext.applyAndCommitStagedDomainEvents(bankAccount);

            return bankAccount;
        });
    }
}
```
