Debugging an event-sourced system poses some challenges. While database client tools (such as [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for PostgreSQL) allow you to inspect the underlying data, they often fall short when it comes to understanding the behavior and aggregate state over time.

For example, you might run a query like this:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    domain_events
WHERE
    "aggregateType" = 'BankAccount'
    AND "aggregateId" = '<id>'
ORDER BY
    "sequenceNumber" DESC;
```

While this gives you raw domain events, there are several limitations:

- You can inspect event payloads, but not the effect those events had on aggregate state.
- You don't know the state the aggregate was in at the time when the event was created.
- You can’t easily reconstruct or time-travel through the state of the aggregate.
- You lack type-safe tooling for filtering or formatting events.
- You’re forced to interpret raw event payloads, which can be difficult to analyze.

Luckily, DugongJS comes with a developer tool that lets you inspect and interact with event-sourced aggregates directly from the command line. This can be very useful for debugging, troubleshooting and auditing. Let's explore how it works.

### Installing the CLI

First, install the `dugong` cli:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @dugongjs/cli
```

Or alternatively, install it globally:

```bash
npm install --global @dugongjs/cli
```

Test the installation by running the following command:

```bash
dugong --help
```

### Configuring the Application For the CLI

To use the CLI, we'll need to expose an API for the CLI from our service. We'll use a [NestJS microservice](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics) to set this up.

First, install the following packages:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/microservices @dugongjs/nestjs-microservice-query
```

Next, we'll need to convert our application to a [hybrid application](https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/hybrid-application), because we'll be listening for requests from both HTTP and TCP:

```typescript title="src/main.ts" showLineNumbers
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { Transport, type MicroserviceOptions } from "@nestjs/microservices";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module.js";

async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

    app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>({
        transport: Transport.TCP,
        options: {
            host: "localhost",
            port: 3001
        }
    });

    await app.startAllMicroservices();
    await app.listen(3000);
}

bootstrap();
```

:::warning
Here, we are setting up a TCP microservice on port 3001. **This port should not be exposed to external clients, as it provides direct read-only access to all domain events and aggregates**. Instead, you should expose it on an internal port and use port-forwarding or some other secure connection when you need to access it.
:::

Finally, we'll add the `AggregateQueryMicroserviceModule` to the `AppModule`:

```typescript title="src/app.module.ts" showLineNumbers
import { EventIssuerModule } from "@dugongjs/nestjs";
import { AggregateQueryMicroserviceModule } from "@dugongjs/nestjs-microservice-query";
import { RepositoryTypeOrmModule, TransactionManagerTypeOrmModule } from "@dugongjs/nestjs-typeorm";
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { TypeOrmModule } from "@nestjs/typeorm";
import { BankAccountCommandModule } from "./bank-account/application/command/bank-account.command.module.js";
import { dataSourceOptions } from "./db/data-source-options.js";

@Module({
    imports: [
        TypeOrmModule.forRoot(dataSourceOptions),
        RepositoryTypeOrmModule.forRoot(),
        TransactionManagerTypeOrmModule.forRoot(),
        EventIssuerModule.forRoot({ currentOrigin: "BankingContext-AccountService" }),
        // highlight-next-line
        AggregateQueryMicroserviceModule,
        BankAccountCommandModule
    ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Configuring the CLI

We'll first need to configure the CLI to connect to our application. The quickest way to do this is to set the current context:

```bash
dugong config set-context --current --host localhost --port 3001 --adapter nestjs-microservices --transport tcp
```

:::info
You can create and switch between multiple contexts. Run `dugong config --help` for details.
:::

### Running Basic CLI commands

Next, try running the following commands:

```bash
dugong get aggregates
```

This should display a list of your aggregates.

```bash
dugong get aggregateids BankAccount
```

This should display a list of all unique IDs of the `BankAccount` aggregates you have created.

```bash
dugong get aggregate BankAccount <id>
```

This should return a `BankAccount` aggregate by ID.

```bash
dugong get domainevents BankAccount <id>
```

This should return a list of all domain events for the `BankAccount` aggregate by ID.

### Dugong Studio

The main feature of the CLI is Dugong Studio. Start Dugong Studio by running:

```bash
dugong studio
```

This will launch an interactive terminal UI, as shown in the screenshot below. Here, you can explore your aggregates, time-travel in the event log and view computed diffs on aggregates based on applied domain events.

![DugongJS studio](/img/dugong_cli.png)

The terminal UI consists of 6 panes:

1. **Aggregate Types pane**: Shows a list of all aggregate types. Use the arrow keys to navigate and press enter to select one.
2. **Aggregate Instances pane**: Shows a list of all aggregate instances of the selected type. Use the arrow keys to navigate and press enter to select one.
3. **Aggregate pane**: Shows the selected aggregate instance. When a domain event is selected, the aggregate is built up to the selected event. Cannot be interacted with.
4. **Domain Events pane**: Shows the list of domain events for the selected aggregate instance. Use the arrow keys to select one.
5. **Domain Event pane**: Shows the selected domain event. Cannot be interacted with.
6. **Diff pane**: Shows the diff of the aggregate for the selected domain event against the previous. Cannot be interacted with.

The `TAB` key and `SHIT+TAB` keys can be used to navigate between the different panes.
